## **Introduction**
Mango classification is a critical task in agriculture and commerce. This project develops a robust **deep learning model** using CNN to classify mango images into different categories, such as ripeness level or type. By automating this process, the project contributes to efficient quality control and sorting in mango production.

---

## **Project Objectives**
- Develop a CNN model to classify mango images into predefined categories.
- Achieve high accuracy in classification using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.
- Provide visual insights through metrics like confusion matrices and classification reports.

---

## **Features**
- **Automated Image Preprocessing**: Resize, normalize, and augment mango images for better model performance.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Custom CNN architecture with multiple layers for effective feature extraction.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- **Scalability**: Extendable to classify other fruits or agricultural products.

---

## **Dataset Information**
- **Source**: A dataset of mango images categorized by type and ripeness.
- **Classes**: Includes categories such as ripe, unripe, and overripe.
- **Dataset Size**: Approximately 2000+ images, divided into training, validation, and test sets.

### **Sample Dataset Loading Code:**
```python
dataset = tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory(
    "path_to_mango_dataset",
    seed=123,
    shuffle=True,
    image_size=(256, 256),
    batch_size=32
)
```

## **Model Architecture**
The model consists of the following layers:

- **Input Layer**: Accepts images of size `(256, 256, 3)`.
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract meaningful features using filters.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality while retaining important features.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Combine extracted features for final classification.
- **Output Layer**: A softmax activation function for multiclass classification.

### **Model Summary Code**
```python
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(256, 256, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])
model.summary()
```

## **Installation Guide**

- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-learn**

### **Steps to Install**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/mango-classification.git
   cd mango-classification
   ```
### **Install the Required Packages**

```
## **Training and Evaluation**

### **Data Augmentation**
Augmentation techniques used include:
- Rotation
- Flipping
- Zooming
- Contrast adjustments  
These techniques help improve the model's generalization and reduce overfitting.

### **Model Compilation**
Compile the model with the following configuration:
```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### **Training**
Train the model using the prepared dataset:
```python
history = model.fit(dataset, epochs=20, validation_split=0.2)
```

### **Evaluation**
Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset:
```python
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(dataset)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

## **Results and Analysis**

- **Accuracy**: Achieved over 90% accuracy on the test dataset.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Demonstrates model performance in distinguishing between classes.

## **Challenges and Solutions**

### **Challenges**
1. **Class Imbalance**: Unequal representation of categories in the dataset.
2. **Overfitting**: The model tended to overfit on the training data.

### **Solutions**
- Applied **data augmentation** and **oversampling** to balance the dataset.
- Introduced **dropout layers** and **early stopping** to mitigate overfitting.

## **Future Enhancements**
1. **Multi-fruit Classification**: Extend the model to classify other fruits or agricultural products.
2. **Transfer Learning**: Use pre-trained models like **InceptionV3** for improved performance.
3. **Deployment**: Develop a web or mobile application for real-time mango classification.
